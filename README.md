Coming soon.....
A wiki and movie review page of our favourite TV characters <3


This page will display a list of matching movies along with their details, such as release date, rating, and plot summary. Users can also filter the results based on criteria like genre, release year, and rating. This project will help you learn about making API calls, handling user input, and displaying dynamic content on a web page.
